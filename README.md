Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to build things, mainly software & games though. I used to write tons of Android apps.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... TalesMUD when i got some time in the evening or weekends. Also a pirate themed 2D pixelart game in Unity3D with C#, not public though.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... way too much, some things being Golang, Svelte.JS and Kotlin/Jetpack Compose.
- âš¡ I would love to learn more about Rust, but there is simply not enough time
